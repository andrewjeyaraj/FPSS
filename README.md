A general fluid power system sizing library 

This library contains methods for sizing fluid power systems for a multitude of applications. 

However, the use cases for which this library has been developed have been mainly aerospace actuation system applications. 

The library has been implemented in using symbolic algebra to enable different types of analyses including system sizing, pump sizing, pressure loss computation and actuator sizing. 

The library can be used in any of the aforementioned modes. Whenever possible, physics-based methods have been used but in some cases rules of thumb, correlation coefficeints and typical values from practice have been applies. These will be indicated as such. 

A detailed set of Jupyter notebook based tutorials are being developed and will be available here at a later date.
